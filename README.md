What is Bit Manipulation?


*** Introduction #***

Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result. It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data that are shorter than a word.

**Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:**

1. Low-level device control
2. Error detection and correction algorithms
3. Data compression
4. Encryption algorithms
5. Optimization

For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits representing those abstractions.

**Bit manipulation can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can speed up coding as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.**__

The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques that you will encounter day-to-day.
